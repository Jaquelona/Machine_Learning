Our deep learning model has a 90% accuracy rate and is a great predictor of whether a planet is, is not, or is a good candidate for being an exoplanet.  

Our second model is only 85% accurate and even with grid search is not as good of a model.

We can assume that these factors are good indicators of an exoplanetâ€™s status, but are not 100% indicative.  The model would be better at predicting new exoplanets by perhaps having more informational categories that we could add to our model to make it more specific.
